Achieving carbon neutrality has become the United Nationâ€™s most urgent mission, but the lack of data, evaluation criteria and associated techniques presents a challenge. Moreover, the energy crisis in 2022 has unexpectedly complicated carbon dioxide (CO2) data, and existing research focuses primarily on CO2 absolute emissions. Policymakers have established milestones on carbon reduction roadmap but have failed to meet them. Therefore, we adopt the new CO2 emission and sink data released in November 2022. Our approach leverages Time Varying Parameter Vector Auto Regression (TVP-VAR) model and Monte-Carlo simulation to monitor the dynamics of net-zero emission roadmap. This approach provides insights into the global pathway towards The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

How to use toolboxes in MATLAB for carbon neutrality simulation using **[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)**.

## **Setup**
To run:
1. Open carbon_neutrality_live_script.mlx
2. Install Econometrics Toolbox, Deep Learning Toolbox
3. Run carbon_neutrality_live_script.mlx

Requires

- [MATLAB R2023a](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- [Econometrics Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/econometrics.html?s_tid=srchtitle_site_search_1_econometrics)
- [Deep Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/deep-learning.html)


## Overview
This example leveraged MATLAB R2023a and according toolboxes to 
1. predict carbon emission for US, UK, China and Japan with **Time Varying Parameter Vector Auto Regression** (TVP-VAR) time series model
2. add **Monte Carlo Simulation** to the TVP-VAR Model to simulate the carbon emission path to achieve carbon neutrality goals in 2050.
3. introduce **Long Short-term Memory** Deep Learning model as an alternative way to predict carbon emission

## Dataset
We use latest data released in Global Carbon Budget (November 2022 version) 
- 50+ countries
- around 100 years (1905-2022)
- variables include the amount of carbon dioxide emission, GDP, population

## Conclusion 

The aim of this example was to show:

- What MATLAB Econometrics Toolbox and Deep Learning Toolbox are
- How it can be applied to simulate climate change data
- Leave a starting point for climate change professionals to use and enhance using their own domain expertise.
